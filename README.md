## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox;
- Mobile-first workflow;
- SaSS.

### What I learned

Working on this project, I was able to start practicing SaSS.
A couple days ago, I was studying about SaSS and I decided to make this project to improve my skills.

### Continued development

For the next one, I will keep working with SaSS, but on a more challenging project, using JS and maybe react.
